## About me

I’m experienced in HTML and CSS,Javascript, React, Redux, Typescript, Jest, Unit testing whit React testing library.

My most powerful skills is my unusual ability to use styled component as no one. I'm also really good setting SOLID patterns in the code structure to get a better and scalable code.
