## About me

I’m a very energetic frontend developer with experience in design and create websites and web applications. 

I’m experienced in HTML and CSS,Javascript, React, Redux, Typescript, Jest, Unit testing with React testing library.

My most powerful skills is my unusual ability to use styled component as no one else. I am also really good setting SOLID patterns in the code structure to design an efficient and scalable code.

I have a lot of experience working with teams, so my communications skills are pretty optimal.
